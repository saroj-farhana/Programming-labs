# MultiModal Sentiment Analysis Using AudioVisual Format On Product Reviews

Introduction:
============
	The main purpose of our project Multimodal sentiment analysis is to analyze the emotions, attitude and opinions from audio visual format. A
company can improve the quality of its product and services by analyzing the reviews about the product. Sentiment analysis is widely used in managing customer relations. There are many textual reviews from which we cannot extract emotions by traditional sentimental analysis
techniques. Some sentences in the textual reviews may derive deep emotions but do not contain any keyword to detect those emotions, so we use audiovisual reviews in order to detect emotions from the facial expressions and by analyzing the voice of the customer. In our project we take audiovisual input and extract emotions from video and audio in parallel from audiovisual input, finally classify the overall review as positive, negative or neutral based on combining overall emotions detected from customers facial expressions and from his voice.
